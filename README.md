HealthDash
=================
Web application dashboard for aggregation of health data from wearables, apps, and services. Developed at Cardinal Health Hackathon at Fuse.

# Problem
By 2020, there will be 50 billion devices connected to the internet. We will be using sensors to collect all kinds of data about our health and wellness. But there is no point in collecting this data if we can't analyze it and make sense of it. Today, there are various wearables and devices that collect this data, but there is no single source to view this data. 

# Solution
HealthDash is a dashboard that aggregates all this data collected from various apps, devices, and services and displays it in a clean and concise manner. The application is very modular, allowing the user the freedom to choose the information that is the most important to them, and to use this data along with valuable feedback to make intelligent, data-driven decisions.
